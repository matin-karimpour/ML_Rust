# ML with Rust

In this project, [Linfa](https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/)'s support vector machine, logistic regression, and decision tree techniques are all compared. The [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) dataset is utilized in this comparison. The table below shows the results.

| Model               | Accuracy     |
| ----                | --------     |
| Decision Tree       | *0.8202247*  |
| Logistic Regression | *0.23033708* |
| SVM                 | *0.8033708*  |
